some functions have formulas to derive answers 

these are better than brute forcing the code to do all the work

use float varriables for large numbers then conver it back to a larger int 

formulas >>> brute force 
Examples
- sum product
- probability
- transpose (2D array)
- fourier transformer (examples and learn more about them)
